# Instructions for coding agents - CTF Master

## Product goal
Mobile-first PWA teaching Linux and CTF through interactive, causal labs. Progression: explanation -> user attempt -> feedback -> variation -> transfer without hints.

## Constraints
- React + TypeScript + Vite; prefer small, maintainable changes.
- All command execution in `src/core/linux.ts` is a simulated interpreter. NEVER execute user input in a shell, browser eval or backend process.
- Check mission success based on resulting state/actions, not exact answer strings.
- Preserve local session progress when evolving data structures; introduce versioned migration when needed.
- Never expose the flag in UI hints or README; flags are discoverable via terminal actions in the intended lab. In-browser static flags are *not* secret and do not constitute secure server-side challenge validation.
- Keep UI usable on touchscreens, mobile portrait, keyboards and screen readers.
- Introduce external infrastructure only for isolated, intentionally provisioned labs in future iterations.
- Do not bloat validation. Before a PR: `npm run build` and manual smoke test for the changed mission. Add focused automated tests when engine becomes more complex.

## Near-term priority
Next PR: verify the 21-lesson Academy with its safe, read-only text pipelines in a real phone/browser and perform offline PWA QA from docs/MOBILE_QA.md. The pipeline is NOT Bash: maximum five stages, no mutation, redirects or host execution. Preserve 21 intros, 21 transfers, 16 missions, 20 reviews, old localStorage keys, and grading integrity. Do not expand network labs before device QA.
